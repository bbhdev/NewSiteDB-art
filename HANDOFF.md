# HANDOFF — NewSiteDB-art

A briefing for whoever (next Claude session, or human) picks this project up
without the context of the conversation that produced versions ~v0.8.5–0.8.72.
Read this top-to-bottom once; reference back as needed.

## What this project is

A Kirby-based site where the visual identity is a layer of animated SVG line
art. Two surfaces:

- **Runtime** (`assets/js/app.js`) — public-facing renderer that reads a JSON
  payload inlined by `site/snippets/lines-layer.php`, paints SVG paths into
  `#lines-layer`, and animates them with GSAP / ScrollTrigger as the user
  scrolls.
- **Editor** (`assets/js/dev-draw.js`) — reached at `/dev/draw`. Lets the
  designer draw, group, palette-pick, set per-line behaviors, snapshot data,
  clean up orphans. Saves to disk via custom Kirby routes in `site/config/config.php`.

The user (designer/dev) interacts almost entirely with the editor; the runtime
is the publishing target.

`project-hierarchy.csv` (at repo root) maps every file/dir to its role.
`scripts/migrate-content.php` is the schema-migration CLI for porting old
content shapes.

## Versioning conventions

- `VERSION` (root) — app semver. Bumped on every commit. Used by
  `site/config/config.php` as `option('version')` → cache-buster `?v=…` on
  every CSS/JS include.
- `SCHEMA_VERSION` (root) — integer. Bumped **only** when the on-disk content
  shape changes incompatibly with older snapshots. Snapshots embed the schema
  version in their `meta.json`; load refuses on mismatch. Currently `1`.
- Commit messages are detailed for a reason — they're the project's design
  journal. Write them that way; the next session will read them.

## Architecture, top-level

### Content / data model

Per the v4 schema:

- `content/_shared/masters.json` — site-wide master definitions (`id`, `name`,
  `kind`, `params`/`points`/`segments`/`d`, `stroke`, `width`, `scope`). Shared
  identity across classes.
- `content/<page>/<class>/instances.json` — per-class instances. Each has
  `{ id, masterId, groupId, positionOffset, behaviors[], overrides }`. Different
  classes have different per-class `id`s for the "same" line, but they share
  the `masterId`.
- `content/<page>/<class>/groups.json` — per-class group records.
- `content/<page>/page.json` — page-level config (`useClasses`, `dims`).
- `content/_shared/palette.json` — site-wide color palette.

**Crucial cross-class identity rules:**

- Lines: `masterId` is the cross-class identity. Per-class `id` is class-local.
- Groups: `name` is the cross-class identity. `id` is class-local.
- Master `name` is also a useful cross-class identity (the `pathRef` fallback uses
  it; see "pathFollow" below).

### Behavior model (per-block)

Each line has a `behaviors[]` array. Each block has:

- **Trigger** — `trigger.when` ∈ scroll-range / page-load / scroll-key /
  in-view-partial / in-view-full / after-previous / scroll-stop / scroll-start.
  With `range`, `selector`, `delay`, `viewportAt`, `repeat`.
- **Duration** — `duration.mode` ∈ scroll / time / loop / pingpong / loopTo.
- **Visual contributions:**
  - `tx`, `ty`, `rot` (per-block progress-weighted deltas)
  - `translateMode` ∈ fixed / driftX / driftY / driftBoth / pathFollow
  - `fadeOpacity` + `opacityFrom` / `opacityTo`
  - `drawIn` / `drawInDirection`
  - `pathRef`, `pathRefName`, `pathAlignToTangent`, `pathEndMode` (path-follow)
  - `rotateOriginX` / `rotateOriginY` (pivot — but only block 0's is honored, see "Known Limitations")

### Composition rules (in `app.js#computeAt`)

- **translate / rotate**: SUM across blocks each frame. bp=0 contributes 0 —
  the contribution-based model handles bp=0 naturally.
- **opacity**: last-active block wins (reverse-walk, first active with
  fadeOpacity sets opacity = lerp(from, to, bp)).
- **pathFollow**: last-active wins, similar to opacity. The chosen block's
  contribution REPLACES the block's own tx/ty in computeAt; other blocks'
  Fixed/Drift deltas still sum on top. Also replaces `positionOffset` in
  writeAt (path drives absolute position).
- **loopTo**: contributes `-bp * snapshotted_chain_offset`. At bp=1, cancels
  the chain exactly, parking the line at the target block's start position.

### Frame-loop architecture

For each line: `computeAt(scrollP, nowSec) → { tx, ty, rot, opacity, pathFollowActive }`.
`writeAt` calls computeAt and applies as a single SVG transform + opacity
setAttribute.

- ScrollTrigger fires `onUpdate(self)` → calls `writeAt(self.progress, now)`.
- For time-driven blocks (any duration ≠ scroll, or any drift), additionally
  `gsap.ticker.add(tick)` runs writeAt every frame.
- **First frame priming (v0.8.71):** `writeAt(st.progress || 0, now)` is called
  once explicitly right after `ScrollTrigger.create`. Without this, ScrollTrigger
  doesn't fire onUpdate at setup when scroll=0 + range.start=0, so behaviors
  that have a non-default state at bp=0 (e.g. opacity 0.5→1) would jump on
  first scroll. This is a pattern worth remembering.

### Scroll-stop / scroll-start triggers (v0.8.77, simplified v0.8.78)

Event-driven triggers fed by a single global passive-scroll listener with a
150 ms debounce. The watcher emits two events to every subscriber:

- `scroll-stop` — user was scrolling, then no scroll event for 150 ms.
- `scroll-start` — user resumes scrolling after a stopped state.

Each subscribed block has a `delay` (seconds). On the watcher event it
schedules its fire at `t + delay`. The OPPOSITE event before the delay
elapses CANCELS the pending fire (symmetric). On fire, the block's own
`activationState[i]` is set to now — its duration starts running normally,
identical to any other trigger.

`hasTime` is force-true for any block with these triggers, so the ticker
runs and the block's progression gets painted even when the user isn't
scrolling.

### Cross-object Start / Stop side effects (v0.8.79)

Every trigger (not just scroll-stop/start) carries optional `startObjectId`
and `stopObjectId` fields. The target is identified by class name
(`masterId` for lines; `name` for groups — v1 implements line/masterId
only). When the host block's trigger fires, the runtime calls
`applyObjectEffects(trigger)` which dispatches to each matching
controller registered in the shared `objectRegistry` keyed by masterId.

- **Start** — re-arms target's triggers and fires them. Page-load fires
  immediately; in-view + scroll-key re-evaluate. No-op if the target is
  already animating normally (won't interrupt a healthy animation).
  Implementation: `armTrigger(i, b)` extracted from the original
  `blocks.forEach` setup; `rearm()` tears down per-block listeners
  (`blockTriggerTeardown[i]`) and re-runs `armTrigger` for every block.
- **Stop** — clean reset to neutral pre-fire state (NOT pause). Optional
  cleanups: `stopFadeOut` (opacity → 0) and `stopReturnHome` (translation
  + rotation → 0), sharing `stopDurationSec` + `stopEasing`. The
  cleanup tween snapshots `lastContribution` (captured at end of every
  `writeAt`) and scales tx/ty/rot/opacity toward zero by
  `easing(elapsed/dur)`. At finalize, all per-block trigger state clears
  and the target ends ready to fire again from frame zero. Re-stop during
  cleanup is ignored; re-start during cleanup cancels and re-arms.
- **Init ordering**: page-load triggers fire during per-line init, but
  target controllers may not exist yet. `pendingObjectEffects` queues
  effects while `objectInitFlushing === true`; the queue flushes after
  all lines are registered (end of `renderClassContent`).
- **Cleanup paint without permanent ticker**: lines whose blocks are all
  scroll-driven don't run `gsap.ticker`. `requestStop` installs a
  temporary `cleanupTicker` (`gsap.ticker.add(writeAt)`) removed at
  cleanup finalization or on `requestStart`.

Authored in editor via Start object / Stop object dropdowns (one per
trigger). When Stop is set, four sub-fields appear: Fade-out checkbox,
Return-home checkbox, Cleanup duration (s), Cleanup easing. Self is
excluded from the picker; the picker enumerates unique masterIds across
`state.lines`. Re-render gate in `updateBehaviorTrigger` includes
`startObjectId` / `stopObjectId` so sub-field visibility updates.

Earlier v0.8.77 same-line `startBlockIndex` / `stopBlockIndex`
side effects were ripped out in v0.8.78 as architecturally wrong —
acting on other blocks of the same object is pointless (each block has
its own trigger).

## Recent architectural decisions and why

### Why `isBlockActive` instead of `bp <= 0` to gate contribution (v0.8.54, v0.8.67)

When a block has `bp === 0` (legitimate start-of-animation state, like scroll
range 0–X at scroll=0), it MUST still contribute its starting value. Old code
used `if (bp <= 0) continue` which skipped this case → default value displayed
→ jump on first scroll. `isBlockActive(i, scrollP, nowSec)` correctly returns
true at bp=0 (when the trigger has fired) and false only pre-trigger. This
pattern lives in two places — opacity composition and pathFollow reverse pass.
Any future "active block contribution" code should use `isBlockActive`, never
`bp <= 0`.

### pathFollow guide resolution chain (v0.8.57, v0.8.60, v0.8.61)

The guide is resolved by trying, in order:

1. `layer.querySelector('[data-master-id="…"]')` where pathRef is a master id.
2. Fallback: line-name lookup if `pathRefName` is set. Walks current class's
   lines, finds match by `(l.name || l.id) === pathRefName`, then finds its
   DOM element by line id.

Hidden lines that are referenced as guides are rendered invisibly
(`visibility: hidden + pointer-events: none`) so the runtime can sample their
geometry without showing them. See `guideMastersNeeded` / `guideNamesNeeded`
pre-scan at the top of `renderClassContent`.

Why the name fallback: per-class master drift exists in some datasets (the
"same" logical line ends up with different masterIds across classes due to
historical save/re-mint cycles). Master id is the canonical identity; name is
the practical fallback.

### Drag-to-reorder and Z-stacking (v0.8.28–v0.8.30)

Sidebar order is the canonical Z. `state.lines` is kept flattened-by-group via
`rebuildLinesInGroupOrder` after every structural mutation. Renderer iterates
`state.lines` in order → SVG paint order → canvas Z. Top of sidebar = first
in array = drawn first = furthest back.

Drag handles:
- Behavior block: title strip is the drag handle. `moveBehaviorBlock` splices
  the array and remaps `loopTo.duration.target` indices via id-preserving lookup.
- Line row: above/below drop reorders within group OR cross-group (changes groupId).
- Group row: distinct drag type (`text/x-group-id`). Cross-class fan-out via
  `forSiblingGroupsByName` (groups identified by name).

ALL-mode fan-out for line/group reorders uses `applyReorderToSibling` which
preserves orphans (items in sibling that don't exist in current) by anchoring
them to their immediate-predecessor shared item from the pre-reorder sibling
sequence.

### Snapshot library (v0.8.34)

`library/<name>/meta.json + content/` is a local backup of the entire content
tree. Gitignored. The editor's Master library modal exposes Save and Load.
Load wipes content/, copies the snapshot's content/ back, then `location.reload()`s.
Schema-version-locked: a snapshot taken under one schema can't be loaded into
another.

### Editor UX batch — Parameters, duplication, relationships, label drag (v0.8.89–v0.8.108)

This batch hardened the editor around editing primitives, understanding
linked objects, and working with dense drawings.

**Parameters section unified (v0.8.93–v0.8.96).** Position X/Y is now
shown for every object kind (primitives AND poly/path/etc.), not just
primitives. For non-primitives the position is the bbox top-left in
absolute coords (was: relative offset, which confused everyone).
v0.8.96 fixed a compounding-delta bug where manual entry of Position
X/Y applied the delta on top of the current `positionOffset` instead
of replacing the absolute value — the writeable target is the offset,
but the field reads/writes in absolute terms.

**Duplicate object / group from side panel (v0.8.92).** The duplicate
clones to a new line (and new master if cloning the only instance of
a master), preserving behaviors. Linked duplicates (Alt-drag of a
linked instance — see below) share the master.

**Group-delete cascade warning (v0.8.97–v0.8.98).** Deleting a group
that holds the only home of certain linked instances WOULD cascade-
delete sibling instances in other classes. The dialog now lists those
collateral instances and offers a three-way choice: Keep (remove only
local lines, masters survive), Delete too (cascade), Cancel.
"Cancel/Delete anyway" was renamed Keep/Delete too because "cancel"
read as "cancel the whole operation". Companion: the line panel now
has a Group selector so a linked object can be moved between groups
without delete-and-recreate.

**Dense-drawing translate affordances (v0.8.99–v0.8.100).** A path
with many vertex handles had no place to grab for translation — every
pixel was a handle. Three orthogonal solutions, all shipped:

1. Arrow keys nudge by `state.nudgeStepMM` (default 1 mm, configurable
   in canvas panel). Shift × 10. Uses `shiftLineBy` + `forSiblingsOf`
   for ALL-mode fan-out.
2. Bbox move grip — orange ✥ square positioned JUST OUTSIDE the bbox
   top-left (offset by its own size + a gap) so it doesn't conflict
   with the bbox handles that conventionally sit at top-left. Its
   pointermove writes via `nudgeSelectionBy(dx, dy, {snapshot: false})`
   to avoid re-rendering handles mid-drag.
3. Alt-drag on ANY handle translates instead of editing the handle.
   Implemented as an early `if (e.altKey) return;` in the vertex/
   primitive handle pointerdown handlers, so the event bubbles to
   the svg-level translate path. Shift is reserved for multi-select;
   Alt is the standard "modify gesture" modifier.

**Linked-duplicate naming (v0.8.100).** When the user creates a
linked duplicate (vs an unlinked copy), the new instance's name gets
a " linked" suffix (no double-append on repeat), making it visually
distinct in the sidebar without changing the underlying master name.

**Instance↔master relationships display (v0.8.101–v0.8.108).** The
big one. To understand a drawing the user needs to see at a glance
which objects share a master. The system:

- `computeMasterRelationships()` walks `state.pageConfig.useClasses`
  to count instances per masterId across the active class set. Masters
  with ≥2 instances anywhere get a sequential letter badge (A, B, …
  AA, AB) via `letterBadge(idx)`. Singletons get no badge.
- **Color**: hues are assigned by golden-angle walk
  `(25° + idx × 137.508°) mod 360`, NOT by hashing the master id.
  Hashing gave color collisions on consecutive letters; golden-angle
  guarantees max perceptual separation. Saturation 70% / lightness 32%
  so white text reads cleanly.
- **Sidebar row badge**: in the line list, every row gets a circle
  slot in the right-side column. The badge gates on **in-class**
  sibling count (filtered to `state.lines`), not the global rel.count.
  Reason: clicking the badge / master chip selects in-class siblings
  only, so cross-class siblings would promise something the action
  can't deliver. Singletons get a hollow neutral gray ring (`.is-empty`)
  instead of nothing — keeps the column visually aligned, reads as
  "nothing to say here".
- **Canvas badge** (`renderLinkBadges`): same gating, same hollow-ring
  for singletons. Visibility gate: showLabels on → all instances; off
  → only selected ones. Pointer events disabled (purely informational).
- **Master chip** in the line panel header: visible only when in-class
  count ≥ 2; clicking selects every sibling in the current class.
  Singletons get no chip (no relationship to surface).
- **Label block now carries the short master ID** as a `[abc12]` prefix
  between the group tag and the name (v0.8.103). Was originally a
  separate floating text element next to the canvas badge — moved into
  the label block for legibility (white background, no hue tint).

**Draggable labels (v0.8.104–v0.8.108) — three SVG gotchas worth
remembering.**

When labels overlap because objects cluster, the user can drag any
label to reposition it. `line.labelOffset = {x, y}` (optional,
additive — no SCHEMA_VERSION bump) stores the displacement; a 2 px
leader in the label border color connects the moved label back to
its anchor. Drag the label back within 2 units of the anchor to clear
the offset (no explicit reset affordance).

The implementation went through three failed attempts. Each surfaced
a real SVG / DOM gotcha:

1. **`pointer-events: all` on a `<g>` is a no-op.** SVG groups are
   not painted, so there's no hit surface. The cursor changes
   (CSS applies) but pointerdown never fires unless a CHILD is hit.
   Fix: put `pointer-events: all` on the painted `.ed-label-bg-outer`
   rect. Children with `pointer-events: none` correctly pass through
   to the rect underneath.
2. **Calling a layer-clearing render mid-drag kills the gesture.**
   `renderLabels()` does `labelsG.innerHTML = ''` — that destroyed
   the dragged `<g>`, released the pointer capture, and silently
   dropped subsequent pointermove events. Fix: mutate `transform` and
   the leader's `x2`/`y2` in-place during pointermove; only call
   `renderLabels()` on pointerup. This pattern applies anywhere else
   where a drag operates on a re-rendered layer.
3. **Lazy leader-line creation.** If the label starts at offset (0,0)
   (no leader yet rendered), the first pointermove has to create the
   leader element on the fly and insert it into `labelsG` before the
   label group. Tag with `data-line-id` so subsequent drags find it.

CSS cache-busting note: `assets/css/dev-draw.css` is included with
`?v=…` in `site/templates/draw.php`, so a `VERSION` bump invalidates
the cache. If a CSS-only change doesn't visually take effect after
hard-reload, check that `VERSION` was bumped.

### Floating-panel infrastructure (v0.8.110, Step 1)

Side-panel disclosure was getting overloaded — keeping everything open
forced the user to hold the whole panel layout in their head. Rather
than redesign the sidebar around progressive disclosure alone, the
direction taken is **free-floating, draggable, non-modal panels**
opened on demand. The side panel will eventually become a high-level
navigator/launcher; topic editors (Behaviors, Parameters, Style,
Master info, Library/Snapshots, per-class Overview) migrate one at a
time to the floating system in subsequent steps.

**v0.8.110 ships only the framework + a stub `demo` panel** — no
existing UI moved — so drag / resize / pin / close / per-class
persistence got validated end-to-end before any user-visible risk.

Architecture:
- `<div id="panel-host">` in `draw.php`: fixed full-viewport overlay,
  `pointer-events: none` itself; individual `.ed-floating-panel`
  children opt back in. Sits outside `.ed-body` so panels can fly
  over the toolbar/sidebar/canvas without fighting the grid.
- `PANEL_REGISTRY` (in `dev-draw.js`): `{ type → { title,
  defaultSize, defaultPos, followsSelection?, render(body, ctx) } }`.
  `register(type, def)` allows late additions.
- `PanelManager`: `open / close / togglePin / bringToFront /
  notifySelection / notifyDataChanged / restore / listOpen`. New
  panels of the same type cascade by +24px and are bumped to the top
  of the z-stack via a monotonically-increasing counter (no actual
  CSS-managed stack — we own it).
- Per-panel state: `{ id, type, objectId?, pinned, x, y, w, h, z }`.
  Persisted as a JSON array under `ed-panels-${pageId}-${classId}` —
  **scoped per class**, since class switches change what's
  selectable. Stale persisted types (a removed registry entry) are
  silently dropped on restore.
- Drag uses the header with pointer-capture; resize uses a corner
  grip element (not CSS `resize:` — that's textarea-only and can't
  coexist with persist). Both persist **on pointerup only**, never
  on every move. Position is clamped so ≥ 40px of header stays in
  the viewport (panels can't be dragged unreachable).
- Pin semantics: clicking 📌 binds the panel to the current primary
  selection's `objectId` and freezes that binding. Pinned panels
  ignore selection changes and look the object up across all
  `byClass` buckets (so a pinned panel survives class switches).
  Unpinning clears `objectId` and re-follows selection.
- Selection hook: a single inline `PanelManager.notifySelection()`
  at the end of `renderSelectionPanel` (already the convergence
  point of ~20 selection-mutation sites). **Do not** try to hook by
  reassigning the function — strict mode + function-declaration
  bindings make that unreliable. Direct inline call is also easier
  to grep for.
- Class switch: `switchClass` ends with `PanelManager.restore()` so
  the new class's persisted panel layout is rebuilt.

Narrow-screen (<768px) fallback: `.ed-panel-host` becomes
`position: static` and floating panels collapse into document-flow
blocks (no drag/resize). Untested in practice; the editor isn't
really usable on a phone anyway.

**v0.8.111** bumped sidebar to 15px and floater base to 15px (from
0.88em ~12.3px). Both were too small for sustained reading.

**v0.8.112 (Step 2a)** lifted the single-select line panel out of
the sidebar into a floating `object` panel that auto-opens on
single-select. `renderLinePanel(line, host, panelState)` — the same
function paints either into the sidebar (legacy) or a floating
panel body. Sidebar's single-select slot now shows just a compact
hint (`name · group · kind` + 🪟 Open/focus button).

**v0.8.113 (Step 2b+c, bundled)** rebuilt the BEHAVIORS section
inside the object panel as a block-name list. One row per block:
`Block N · <trigger> · <effect>` (auto-generated by
`behaviorAutoName`, derived from `trigger.when` and the dominant
param actually set) + ✕ delete button. Clicking a row opens
(or re-binds) a `behavior-block` floating panel positioned to the
right of the parent object panel. One child per parent — clicking
another row re-uses the same child panel. PanelManager gained
`updatePanel(panelId, patch)`, `closeChildrenOf(parentId)`, and
parent/child fields in panel state (`parentId`, `blockId`).
`close()` cascades to children. Binding-change cascade
(`prevBound !== nextBound` for unpinned `object` panels)
auto-closes stale children — moved into `renderPanel` so it fires
regardless of which notify path triggered the re-render.
`renderSelectionPanel`'s fan-out switched from `notifySelection`
to `notifyDataChanged` so non-followsSelection panels
(like `behavior-block`) re-render on block edits / deletes / moves.

Visual: the base panel ring is now the former pinned blue (2px,
`#4f8acb`) so floaters stand off the canvas clearly; pinned panels
take a stronger warm accent (3px, `#e08a2c`).

**v0.8.114 / v0.8.115 (testing-feedback batch on Step 2b+c)**

- `behaviorAutoName` audit: derived effect list from a grep of every
  key written by `updateBehaviorParam` / `updateBehaviorTrigger`.
  Surfaces multi-effect blocks ("translate + stops Brown dotty") and
  cross-object side effects (`trigger.stopObjectId` / `startObjectId`)
  that the v0.8.113 detector missed. Stop/start effects resolve the
  target's master.name (falls back to lines.name, then masterId).
- Always-on multi-block additive paragraph collapsed into an ⓘ icon
  on the BEHAVIORS divider (native `title` tooltip). New
  `.ed-help-icon` style for reuse.
- Group picker stages + confirms before calling `moveLinesToGroup`;
  cancel reverts via `notifyDataChanged`. Single-membership model
  confirmed (no multi-group UI needed).
- Hard-stick parent/child panels: dragging any panel in a tree moves
  every member by the same delta (root resolved via
  `findRootPanelId`, snapshot via `collectTree`, applied in
  `onMove`). Resizing a parent slides children to track the new
  right edge (`repositionChildrenOf`).
- Behavior-block panels get a brighter teal ring (3px, `#4fe0c8`) via
  `.ed-floating-panel--block` so the child/peer distinction reads at
  a glance.
- **Bug fix in `close()`**: delete-before-recurse + self-exclude. Old
  order (recurse → delete) opened a stack-overflow door if any
  parentId cycle ever existed in `panels`. Cycles shouldn't be
  reachable today, but defense-in-depth — the recursive close should
  not depend on `parentId` graph correctness.
- **v0.8.116**: re-clicking an already-selected single object on the
  canvas now reopens its closed floating panel (canvas click handler
  short-circuits `renderSelectionPanel` when selection doesn't change,
  so the auto-spawn check is mirrored inline in the
  `pressedSelected` branch).
- **v0.8.117**: per-type "last seen" geometry memory. On close, a
  parent-less panel's `(x, y, w, h)` is saved under
  `ed-panel-lastpos-<pageId>-<classId>` (one slot per panel type).
  On open without explicit geometry, that slot wins over the
  registry default — so a close-then-reopen (whether for the same
  object or a different one) lands the panel where the user last
  parked it. Child panels skip this — their position is derived
  from the parent via hard-stick.

**v0.8.119 (Step 2d)** lands the multi-select fan-out: every time the
selection set grows to 2+ objects, one pinned 'object' panel opens
per selected object (skipping objects that already have a pinned
panel). When the new-panel count exceeds
`state.multiSelectPanelLimit` (Settings → "Multi-select panel limit",
persisted via `ed-multi-panel-limit`, default 5), a confirm() asks
the user before fan-out. Dedup memo `lastMultiSpawnKey` (sorted-ids
joined) prevents re-firing on every render of the same set;
collapsing to single/empty selection clears the memo. Default
positions cascade via the existing `open()` +24px-per-same-type
nudge. Settings dialog grew a new `settingNumberRow` helper for
the numeric input.

**v0.8.120 (Step 2d polish)**: cascade restored on top of `lastPos`
(multi-spawn panels were stacking at the remembered position because
`lp.x/y` overrode `defPos + dx`); confirm() deferred via
`requestAnimationFrame` so the selection paint lands before the modal
blocks the UI. `lastMultiSpawnKey` is set immediately at the top of
`spawnMultiSelectObjectPanels` so the deferred body can't re-fire.

**v0.8.125 (no auto fan-out, objectId-aware opt-click)**: two fixes
to the gesture model:

1. Removed the auto multi-select fan-out call inside
   `renderSelectionPanel`. shift-click in the canvas or sidebar to
   extend a selection no longer auto-spawns N pinned object panels —
   selection and panel-opening are independent intents.
   `spawnMultiSelectObjectPanels` is kept as a callable helper for a
   future explicit "open panels for all" affordance, but never auto-
   fires.

2. opt-click panel toggle now matches by `objectId` instead of just
   "is there an unpinned follower." Previously, opt-clicking an
   object that already had a pinned panel (e.g. from an earlier
   manual pin, or from the now-removed auto fan-out) opened a
   *second* unpinned panel for the same object. New logic in
   `toggleObjectPanelFor(objectId)`:
   - if a pinned panel exists with `objectId === target` → close it
   - else if the unpinned follower exists AND target is
     `selectedIds[0]` → close it
   - else open one — unpinned if target is the primary selection,
     pinned-for-target otherwise
   
   The call site passes the actually-clicked id (the topmost hit at
   the click point), not `selectedIds[0]`, so opt-clicking a non-
   primary object in a multi-select opens a panel for the object
   the user actually pointed at.

**v0.8.124 (opt-click for panel, cmd/shift back to multi-select)**:
corrected v0.8.123's modifier map per user feedback. cmd-click and
shift-click are standard multi-select extend gestures and shouldn't
have been repurposed. opt (alt) is now the panel-toggle modifier.
The "plain re-click reopens a closed panel" gesture from v0.8.123
was dropped — too implicit, conflicts with selection-cycle. Final
map: alt → panel toggle; shift/cmd/ctrl → multi-select extend;
plain → pure selection cycle, no panel side effects. No deferred
logic in the click path — toggle fires immediately on the pointerup
that recognized opt-click.

**v0.8.123 (explicit panel-open gesture)**: removed the single-select
auto-spawn of the 'object' follower panel. First click on an object
now JUST selects — the user might be about to drag, extend the
selection, or open the panel, and the previous "open on every fresh
selection" behavior fought drag-to-move and shift-extend. The panel
is now opened by an explicit gesture handled in the canvas pointerup
code:

- Plain re-click on the *already-selected single* object → toggle
  the follower panel (open if closed, close if open).
- Cmd-click (alone, no shift) on any object → one-shot select +
  panel toggle. If the hit object isn't selected, it becomes the
  sole selection; the follower panel is then toggled. Cmd-click on
  an already-selected object with panel open → closes it.
- Shift-click keeps its existing multi-select extend semantics
  (toggleInSelection) — split out from the old combined
  "modifier-click" branch.
- Empty-area click → clear selection (unchanged).

Mechanics: `selectionAtPointerDown` is snapshotted at pointerdown,
*before* any implicit selectOnly fires for the first-click-on-an-
unselected-line case. pointerup compares the post-click new
selection against that pre-down snapshot; the toggle only fires
when the object was already selected before the gesture started,
which cleanly separates first-click-to-select from re-click-to-
toggle. `toggleObjectFollowerPanel` is the shared helper. The
v0.8.116 inline auto-open inside the pointerdown `pressedSelected`
branch was removed — its job is now done by the pointerup toggle.

Multi-select fan-out (Step 2d) is intentionally kept — shift-click
extending past 1 is itself an explicit "I want to work with multiple
objects" gesture, so auto-spawning per-object panels there is still
aligned with user intent.

**v0.8.122 (double-rAF for multi-spawn confirm)**: single rAF in
v0.8.120 fired pre-paint, so `confirm()` still beat the highlight to
the screen. Double rAF defers the body to the start of the next
frame, guaranteed after the current frame paints.

**v0.8.121 (lastPos drift fix)**: applying `+dx` to `lastPos` (v0.8.120)
created a subtle drift bug — a cascaded multi-spawn panel closed in
place would persist `lastPos + 24px`, then the next spawn would cascade
off the new position, then close → `+48`, etc. Each multi-select cycle
walked the memory away from where the user actually parked panels.
Fix: track `userPositioned` per panel state. Set true only in the
header drag `onUp` (for the entire tree via `collectTree`) and the
resize `onUp` (single panel). `close()` gates `rememberLastPos`
behind this flag, so auto-positioned panels (default / lastPos
restore / multi-spawn cascade) leave the memory untouched on close;
only panels the user actually dragged or resized overwrite it.
`userPositioned` is included in the `persist()` snapshot and threaded
back through `open()` from `restore()` so the flag survives reloads.

Next sub-step (none locked).
Subsequent steps: Parameters / Style / Master info as separate
panel types if the object panel grows unwieldy; per-class Overview;
final sidebar redesign as a navigator over the launchers.

### Orphan cleanup (v0.8.43–v0.8.44)

`🔍 Orphans` button in the Master library header opens a dialog that scans for:
- Orphan masters (no instances anywhere)
- Unused palette colors
- Empty groups (per-class; checkbox opt-in since often intentional)
- Orphan instances (lines with dangling masterId or groupId)

Plus an in-place "0 instances" badge on master library rows.

## Known limitations to be aware of

### Multi-block restrictions still in the runtime

| Property | Multi-block aware? | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| translateX/Y/rotate | Yes (sum) | |
| Drift X/Y | Yes | |
| pathFollow | Yes (last active wins) | |
| fadeOpacity | Yes (last active wins) | |
| drawIn | **Flag from any block (v0.8.68); single tween** | The flag reads from any block, but the dashoffset tween itself is single. Multi-block sequential drawIn (e.g., "draw segment A over scroll 0–0.3, then segment B over 0.3–0.6") would need a per-block ScrollTrigger composition refactor. Planned as "the drawings" feature. |
| rotate pivot (rotateOriginX/Y) | **Block 0 only** (v0.8.70 comment) | The editor exposes per-block pivot, but the runtime uses only block 0's. Multi-block pivot requires switching from `rotate(angle, ox, oy)` shorthand to `matrix(a b c d e f)` composition. See "details on multi-block pivot" discussion in commit messages around v0.8.70. |

### Per-class master drift

Some datasets have per-class master IDs that diverged from each other (the
"same" logical line has different masterIds in narrow / medium / wide). This
came from earlier save/re-mint cycles. Symptoms:
- ALL-mode behavior fan-out writes the same value across classes; pathRef of
  one class's masterId doesn't resolve in another → pathFollow name-fallback
  kicks in.
- `_dumpAllBlocks()` in the editor console reveals this.

If you do a structural data cleanup later, normalizing master ids by name
would prevent a class of weird-cross-class bugs.

### Editor canvas doesn't animate

`/dev/draw` renders lines statically. Animation is runtime-only. If a user
edits a behavior and asks "why isn't it moving in the editor?", that's why.
They have to test on the live page (`/`).

## Diagnostic tools

Available in the EDITOR console after v0.8.33:

- `_dumpLine('blob 1')` — search across every class for a line by id/name/masterId.
  Returns matches + the resolved master records.
- `_dumpAllBlocks()` — per-class table of every line's behavior block ids.

The runtime page area diagnostic (toggled via the editor's "Show page area"
button) displays version + active class:
- v0.8.31: version badge
- v0.8.58: also shows `class: Wide` / `Medium` / `Narrow`

In `app.js` v0.8.56–v0.8.59 added one-shot per-block console logs on the
pathFollow code path. Look for `[pathFollow blk N on lineId]` lines if path
follow ever misbehaves silently.

If a feature silently does nothing in the runtime:
1. Open DevTools console — gsap.ticker traps per-callback errors and prints
   them but doesn't break the page. Errors there explain a lot.
2. Check `data-master-id` exists on the target line (`layer.querySelectorAll('[data-master-id]')`).
3. Check initial-frame priming — does the feature need the v0.8.71 pattern of
   "call writeAt explicitly after ScrollTrigger.create"?

## User's behavioral preference

> **Clarify high-leverage assumptions before acting.** When you're about to do
> something based on an assumption that is BOTH (a) central to the current
> subject AND (b) has strong consequences if wrong, pause and confirm. Not
> every assumption — only the high-leverage ones. The bar: "if this is wrong,
> the next several minutes go in the wrong direction and have to be backed out."

This was explicitly requested as a stable preference; honor it.

Past examples where I should have clarified (and didn't):

- Assumed cross-class master drift was the pathFollow cause, when the real
  cause was a hidden guide line. Spent 3 versions chasing the wrong thing.
- Assumed v0.8.68's `block0params` removal was safe without grepping for
  remaining usages.

Past examples where clarifying first was correct:

- Z-order convention (SVG-natural vs Photoshop-natural) — asked which model.
- ALL-mode fan-out semantics — asked about orphan handling first.

## Misc gotchas worth knowing

- **Content data is gitignored.** `.gitignore` excludes `content/*` JSON files
  (data is local-only by design). I can't see the user's actual line data
  unless they force-add a file or paste content.
- **`_dumpLine` only exists in the editor session**, not in the public-site
  console. They're separate.
- **Snapshot save/load** writes to `library/<name>/` which is gitignored
  (except `.gitkeep`). Snapshots are local backups, not source.
- **`hasMotion`** in app.js gates `writeAt` registration. If a new behavior
  property is added that affects rendering, add it to the `hasMotion` test
  (see v0.8.26 for fadeOpacity, v0.8.53 for pathFollow).
- **drawIn legacy single-tween:** v0.8.68 lifted the "block 0 only" data-side
  restriction but the rendering is still single-tween. If you build "the
  drawings" feature you'll be touching this code.
- **SVG `<g>` is not paintable** — `pointer-events: all` on a group does
  nothing. Put it on a painted child instead. Cursor CSS on the group
  inherits visually, so a hand cursor without a working pointerdown is
  the diagnostic signature. See v0.8.107 label-drag fix.
- **Don't re-render the dragged layer mid-gesture.** If a pointermove
  handler triggers a `layerG.innerHTML = ''` re-render, the dragged
  element disappears, pointer capture releases, and subsequent
  pointermoves are dropped silently. Mutate the live attributes in
  place during the gesture; re-render only on pointerup. See v0.8.108.

## Vocabulary

**Lines** : initially all the graphical objects were lines and this 
designation was always used. 
Later geometric primitives were added and user often uses the 
designation **objects** which is more general and appropriate.
The meaning of both is the same: the word addresses the elementary
graphical items referenced in masters.json and instances.json,
which are the holders of behavior blocks.
